                type ''query'' to retrieve protocol messages in a text-based format.


                The HEAD operation can be used to tell you if the content has changed
                (as GET may not return an HTTP 304 when no content has changed.)


                For example, you may compare the Last-Modified header retrieved during
                a HEAD operation with the Last-Modified header retrieved during a
                previous GET operation. If the headers are the same, the content has
                not changed since the previous GET operation. If the headers are different,
